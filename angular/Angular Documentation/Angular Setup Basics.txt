* Angular Basics
- To create a new angular project: ng new <app_name-NO_spaces in name> --no-strict --standalone false --routing false
- Navigate inside the folder created and start the development server by the command: ng serve
- To include bootstrap in the project, first install bootstrap using npm install --save bootstrap@3; and then add the path to the folder in angular.json file of the project.
- To create components with the CLI use the command: ng generate component name_of_the_component; for example = ng generate component server, where server is the component name.
- To create components with the CLI use the shortcut command: ng g c server.
- To register new component in the module, you need to add the component name in the declarations array, only then Angular will be aware of the new component added. 
- Data Binding:
    - String Interpolation {{}} --> example: {{ propertName }} 
    - Property Binding [] --> example: [disabled]="propertName"
    - Event Binding () --> example: (click)="propertyName/methodName()/expression"
        - In Event Binding you can also pass a special reserved varaible name '$event' as an argument to the method that the event is being binded on, and this special key will read, capture and hold the data of that particular event which can then be used/passed elsewhere.
    - 2 way Binding [()] --> example: [(ngModel)]="propertyName"
- Directives are the instructions in the DOM.
    - *ngIf="propertName/methodName()/Expression" - A structural directive meaning that the element will not be there until and unless the expression is not met.
    - [ngStyle]="{key:value}" - Attribute directive where key is the element selector.
    - [ngClass]="{key:value}" - Attribute directive where key is the class name.
    - *ngFor="let x of typescriptProperty" - structural directive
        - if you want to get the index then *ngFor="let x of typescriptProperty; let i = index" - here you can fetch the index number of the Array.
